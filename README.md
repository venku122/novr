# [Nuclear Option](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2168680/Nuclear_Option/) VR

NOVR is a reworked version of [UUVR](https://github.com/Raicuparta/uuvr) designed and optimized for Nuclear Option.

## Steam Frame development fork

This fork adds Steam Frame controller UI, controller models and hand switching,
optional gamepad output alongside HOTAS, seated head tracking, and configurable
helmet HUD layouts. See [Steam Frame support and builds](README.STEAM-FRAME.md)
for installation, controls, limitations, Debug/Clean builds, and hardware test status.
Eye tracking is experimental and has **not yet passed headset acceptance**.

The upstream installer below installs upstream NOVR, not this fork's development
builds. Use this fork's prerelease assets and guarded deployment scripts for these
changes. Existing BepInEx 5.x is retained.


## User Installation

### Recommended: GUI installer

1. Close Nuclear Option before installing or updating the mod.
2. Download the latest installer from the [NOVR releases page](https://github.com/InfernoSuperNova/novr/releases/latest):
    - **Windows:** `NOVR.Installer-Win.exe`
    - **Linux/Proton:** `NOVR.Installer-Linux`
3. Run the installer directly.
    - On Linux, you may need to make it executable first: `chmod +x NOVR.Installer-Linux`.
4. If Nuclear Option is not found automatically, choose the game folder manually.
    - The selected folder must contain `NuclearOption_Data/Managed`.
5. Click **Install**.
6. Launch Nuclear Option from Steam.

The installer can also update, repair, or uninstall NOVR after it is installed.

### What the installer does

The installer:

- Finds your Nuclear Option install.
- Installs BepInEx 5.x if it is missing.
- Downloads the latest NOVR release zip.
- Installs NOVR into:
    - `BepInEx/plugins/NOVR`
    - `BepInEx/patchers/NOVR`
- Writes the installed NOVR version to `BepInEx/plugins/NOVR/version.txt`.
- On Linux/Proton, attempts to configure the `winhttp` Wine override needed by BepInEx.

Use BepInEx 5.x only. Do not use BepInEx 6.x unless the project explicitly says it is supported.

### Manual zip install

Use this only if the installer does not work for your setup.

1. Close Nuclear Option.
2. Install [BepInEx 5.x](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/latest) into the Nuclear Option game folder.
    - After installing BepInEx, this folder should exist: `Nuclear Option/BepInEx/core`.
3. Download `NOVR.zip` from the [latest NOVR release](https://github.com/InfernoSuperNova/novr/releases/latest).
4. Extract the contents of `NOVR.zip` into `Nuclear Option/BepInEx`.
5. Confirm these files exist:

    ```text
    Nuclear Option/BepInEx/plugins/NOVR/NOVR.dll
    Nuclear Option/BepInEx/patchers/NOVR/NOVR.Patcher.dll
    ```

6. Launch Nuclear Option from Steam.

`NOVR.zip` contains `plugins` and `patchers` folders. Extract it into the existing `BepInEx` folder, not directly into the game root.

### First launch behavior

On game startup, the NOVR BepInEx patcher copies required XR support files into `NuclearOption_Data`. These files may be overwritten every time the game starts.

If the game is already running while installing or rebuilding, Windows may prevent those files from being replaced. Close Nuclear Option before installing, updating, or building the mod.

### Linux/Proton notes

The installer tries to set the required `winhttp` override automatically. If BepInEx does not load under Proton, configure the game's Wine prefix manually so `winhttp` uses `native,builtin`.

See the [BepInEx running under Proton guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/proton_wine.html) for the manual setup.

## Building

These steps are for developers building NOVR from source.

1. Install a .NET/MSBuild toolchain that can build SDK-style .NET Framework 4.8 projects.
    - **Windows:** Visual Studio 2022 or Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022 with the **.NET Framework 4.8 targeting pack** installed.
    - **Linux:** the .NET SDK plus Mono/MSBuild and .NET Framework reference assemblies. Distro package names vary, but you usually want packages such as `dotnet-sdk`, `mono`, `msbuild`/`mono-msbuild`, and `mono-reference-assemblies`/`.NET Framework 4.8 reference assemblies`.
2. Have Nuclear Option installed at:
    - **Linux:** `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Nuclear Option` OR `~/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/Nuclear Option` OR `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Nuclear Option`
    - **Windows:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Nuclear Option` OR `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Nuclear Option` OR `D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Nuclear Option`

    If none of these options work for you, set the `NUCLEAR_OPTION_GAME_DIR` environment variable or pass `/p:NuclearOptionGameDir="path\to\Nuclear Option"` when building.
3. Ensure BepInEx 5.x is installed inside the Nuclear Option directory.
4. Build the `Release` configuration from your IDE of choice. JetBrains Rider is tested; Visual Studio should work too. To build from the command line, run this from the project root:

    ```bash
    dotnet build NuclearOptionVirtualRealityMod.sln -c Release
    ```

    The build output is written under `build-output`, as well as copied directly to the BepInEx directory.

## Installer development

The GUI installer is built with Avalonia. Building it in `Release` automatically publishes raw installer binaries for Linux and Windows into `dist/`:

```bash
dotnet build NOVR.Installer/NOVR.Installer.csproj -c Release
```

Outputs:

- `dist/NOVR.Installer-Linux`
- `dist/NOVR.Installer-Win.exe`

Building the full solution in `Release` also creates `dist/NOVR.zip`, ready to upload as the mod release asset.
